# Solo RPGs: Playing Prewritten Adventures with Warp Mechanics

## Overview
This guide explains how to play prewritten RPG modules solo while introducing surprises and keeping the experience dynamic using the **Warp Mechanics** framework. It combines ideas from the **Mythic GM Emulator** and customized mechanics to allow solo players to enjoy prewritten adventures without sacrificing unpredictability.

## 1. Preparing the Adventure Script
The **Adventure Script** organizes the prewritten module into structured elements. 

### **Core Elements**
- **What?** Define the goal (e.g., *Stop a demonic ritual*).
- **How?** Describe the method (e.g., *Blood sacrifice*).
- **Where?** Identify key locations (e.g., *A shrine below the inn’s cellar*).
- **Why?** Explain the stakes (e.g., *To summon a demon*).
- **When?** Set the timing (e.g., *Tonight*).

### **Setpieces (Scenes)**
List key scenes and their major plot points. For example:
1. **The Forest:**
   - Heavy rain and storm.
   - Encounter beastmen and engage in combat or escape.
2. **The Arrival:**
   - Suspicious innkeeper.
   - Discover clues about the ritual.
3. **The Ceremony:**
   - Interrupted by enemies.
   - Battle against summoned demons.

### **NPCs**
Define characters with key traits:
- **Attributes:** Appearance, abilities, motivations, relationships, and roles.
- Example:
  - *Otto*: Mutant innkeeper, uses brute strength.
  - *Fagor*: Cultist, uses deception and rituals.

### **Locations**
Describe areas in the module with geographic traits and special features.
- *The Inn*: Abandoned but repurposed for rituals.
- *The Cellar*: Blood-stained, holding a demonic shrine.

### **Objects**
Track significant items and artifacts:
- *Demon Statue*: Activates the portal.
- *Amulet*: Cursed item binding the player to the mansion.

### **Others**
Include abstract elements like prophecies or events:
- *A diary revealing the cult’s motives.*

## 2. Using the Warp Check Mechanic
To maintain surprises, use the **Warp Check** when an element appears.

### **Steps:**
1. **Set a Warp Threshold (1–10):** Determines how much deviation occurs.
2. **Roll 1d10:** Compare the roll to the threshold:
   - **Above threshold:** Element appears as written.
   - **Equal/even below threshold:** Element is altered.
   - **Odd below threshold:** Element is completely rewritten.
3. **Attribute Rolls (Optional):** Apply the check to specific details (e.g., NPC motives or appearances).

Example:
- *Encounter Otto, the mutant innkeeper.*
  - **Warp Check Result:** 4 (below threshold, odd).
  - **Change:** Otto is a spy working for the cult instead of a mutant.

## 3. Scene Setting Rules
Use **scene setting** to expand or randomize events.

### **Plot Points:**
Outline major actions for each scene. If fewer than 5 plot points exist, add random events:
1. Roll for new points.
2. Position them randomly.
3. Apply **Warp Checks** to alter or rewrite each point.

Example:
- *Scene: Entering the inn.*
  - Original: Quiet entrance, meet Otto.
  - Warp Result: The door opens to reveal corpses of previous patrons.

### **Random Events Table Modifications:**
Replace ambiguous results with:
- **Gentle Nudge Toward the Adventure:** Introduce clues or leads.
- **Plot Twist!:** Alter an established element.

Example:
- *Roll triggers Plot Twist!*—The amulet is cursed, binding the player to the mansion.

## 4. Playing the Game
1. **Compile the Adventure Script:** Prepare the core, NPCs, and key locations.
2. **Set Warp Threshold:** High values allow more changes; low values preserve structure.
3. **Fix Elements (Optional):** Protect specific details (e.g., *The Ring must be destroyed at Mount Doom*).
4. **Set the First Scene:** Use plot points and apply Warp Checks.
5. **Embrace Deviation:** Let the story evolve through Mythic’s mechanics and Warp Checks.

## 5. Example Gameplay: *Night of Blood*
### **Adventure Script:**
- **Core:** Stop a demonic ritual through blood sacrifice in a cellar shrine.
- **Setpieces:** Forest encounter, inn arrival, and cellar confrontation.
- **NPCs:** Mutants (Otto, Hans, Fagor) and cultists.
- **Objects:** Demon statue and cursed artifacts.

### **Scene Example: The Forest**
- Setup: A storm forces the player into the woods, pursued by beastmen.
- **Warp Check:**
  - **Roll 3 (below threshold, odd):**
    - Instead of beastmen, the enemies are *dombaras*—serpentine monsters.
- Result: The forest chase becomes more dangerous, adding tension and improvisation.

### **Scene Example: The Cellar Ceremony**
- Setup: The ritual is near completion.
- **Warp Check:**
  - **Roll 5 (below threshold, even):**
    - The demon fails to materialize but animates the corpses of the cultists instead.
- Result: The climax shifts focus to undead enemies, increasing unpredictability.

## 6. Expanded Examples and Notes
### **Detailed Scene Example: The Arrival**
- **Original Setup:**
  - Players arrive at the inn and are cautiously greeted by Otto and his companions.
  - They are offered dinner but grow suspicious of the inn’s eerie atmosphere.
- **Warp Check Result (6 - altered):**
  - The NPCs are already waiting for the party, prepared for an ambush.
  - Additional details: Corpses of previous patrons are discovered in the dining hall.

### **Random Event Example:**
- **Trigger:** A sudden plot twist alters the narrative.
  - The High Voivod of Death (Potmal) appears, revealing himself as the mastermind behind the ritual.
  - Clues provided earlier hinted at betrayal, adding tension to the scene.

## 7. Final Tips
- **Balance Chaos and Structure:** Adjust the Warp Threshold to fit your preferred level of deviation.
- **Use Clues to Redirect:** If the narrative drifts too far, add clues to bring it back on track.
- **Experiment with Mechanics:** Feel free to modify mechanics mid-game to suit your style.
- **Community Feedback:** Share scripts and results with solo RPG communities for inspiration.

By combining these mechanics, solo RPG players can enjoy structured adventures with spontaneous twists, enhancing replayability and immersion.
